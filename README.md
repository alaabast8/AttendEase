# AttendEase

## Purpose of the Project

AttendEase is designed to solve the problem of time-consuming and error-prone attendance tracking methods in classrooms and professional settings. The mobile application offers a streamlined solution for doctors, students, and administrators, eliminating the need for paper sign-in sheets and manual recording.


## Project Overview

In the dynamic environment of academic institutions, efficient management of student attendance is critical for ensuring a high-quality and smooth learning experience. This report addresses a prevalent issue faced by universities: the difficulty of tracking and managing attendance records for both faculty and students.

## Problem Statement

- **Faculty Attendance Tracking**: Manual methods are time-consuming, prone to human error, and lack precision and reliability, hampering the smooth functioning of the academic schedule.
- **Student Attendance Monitoring**: The administration faces the challenge of accurately determining the attendance percentage of each student for each course, influencing exam eligibility.
- **Student Transparency**: Students struggle to keep track of their attendance percentage for each course, leading to confusion and uncertainty in academic planning and performance.

These challenges highlight the need for a robust, automated solution to streamline attendance tracking and management in universities.

## Proposed Solution

AttendEase app aims to solve the problem of time-consuming and error-prone attendance tracking methods. The mobile application caters to doctors, students, and administrators, eliminating paper sign-in sheets and manual recording. It offers benefits for everyone:

- **For Doctors**: Doctors can log in, select the semester, choose a course, and create attendance sessions quickly. They can take attendance during lectures and review student attendance records for a particular course throughout the semester.
- **For Administration**: The app aggregates attendance data from all courses across all academic years, providing a holistic view. It automatically calculates attendance percentages, determining student eligibility for exams, eliminating manual calculations and errors.
- **For Students**: The app acts as a personal attendance tracker, providing real-time updates on their attendance percentage in all courses, helping them plan their academic activities to meet university criteria.
